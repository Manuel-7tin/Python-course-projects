**Unilag Treasure Game**

Welcome to the Unilag treasure game, Embark on an exciting virtual journey through the University of Lagos with this Python game, where your every decision can lead to fortune or failure - will you unlock the treasure trove, or come up empty-handed?. 

This project is part of my Python course, and it is designed to showcase my skills and knowledge of Python programming.
This directory contains the main.py file where the code is writing, a venv directory that contains the environment setting and this readme fle.

**How to play the Unilag treasure game**

To play the treasure game, simply download the source code and run the main.py file 
in the tip-calculator folder in your Python environment.
Or use this link and click the play button: https://replit.com/@Emmanuel1707/Tip-calculator?v=1

The game will prompt the user to provide several inputs:

	- The mode of transportation
	- A couple of decisions to make along the way

Your fate hinges on your guidance - you could either unlock the treasure trove or leave it unclaimed.

**Skills and Concepts Learned**

This project allowed me to practice several essential Python programming concepts, including:

	-Control flow,
	-Conditional statements,
	-Conditional operators,
	-Logical operators.

**Future Improvements**

While this game is functional, there is always room for improvement.

Thank you for checking out my Unilag Treasure Game, and I hope you find it as fun and entertaining as I did while creating it!
