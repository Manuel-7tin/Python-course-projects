**Caeser cipher**

Step into the world of mystery and intrigue with the Caesar Cipher program! If you've ever wanted to send secret messages to your friends or loved ones, then this program is just what you need. With the Caesar Cipher, you can transform your messages into an encrypted code that's known only to you and your recipient.

The Caesar Cipher has a long and fascinating history, dating back to ancient Rome. This encryption method was used by Julius Caesar himself to keep his messages safe from prying eyes. And now, you too can use this powerful tool to keep your own secrets safe.

With the Caesar Cipher program, you'll be able to encrypt your messages with ease, using a range of customizable options to make your code as complex as you want. Your messages will be transformed into a mysterious language that only you and your recipient will be able to understand.

This project is part of my Python course, and it is designed to showcase my skills and knowledge of Python programming.
This directory contains the main.py file where the code is writing, a art.py file to store the program logo, a venv directory that contains the environment setting and this readme fle.

**How to use the Caeser Cipher**

To use the Caeser cipher, simply download the source code and run the main.py file in your Python environment.
Or use this link and click the play button: https://replit.com/@Emmanuel1707/caesar-cipher-4-start?v=1.

This program will prompt the user to provide three inputs:

	- The name of the user
	- The choice of action, encode or decode
	- The message to be encrypted or decrypted
	- The shift number with which to code or decode

Whether you're sending messages to your best friend, your significant other, or just keeping a secret diary, the Caesar Cipher program is the perfect tool for you. Your secrets are forever safe with this powerful encryption method.

Note:
	This program only allows you encode or decode as options, any other action passed to the program may result in undefined behaviour.

**Skills and Concepts Learned**

This project allowed me to practice several essential Python programming concepts, including:

	-Creating functions,
	-Positional and keyword arguments,
	-More creating nd using modules,
	-Functions with input.

**Future Improvements**

While this program is functional, there is always room for improvement.

Thank you for checking out my Rock paper scissors game, and I hope you find it as fun and entertaining as I did while creating it!
