**Tip Calculator**

Welcome to the Tip calculator, this Python program calculates the total bill (tip inclusive) after a meal and splits it among all participants. This project is part of my Python course, and it is designed to showcase my skills and knowledge of Python programming.
This directory contains the main.py file where the code is writing, a venv directory that contains the environment setting and this readme fle.

**How to use the Tip Calculator**

To use the Tip calculator, simply download the source code and run the main.py file 
in the tip-calculator folder in your Python environment.
Or use this link and click the play button: https://replit.com/@Emmanuel1707/Tip-calculator?v=1

The program will prompt the user to provide three inputs:

        - The total bill
	- The tip you would like to give
	- The number f people splitting the bill

Based on these inputs, the program will determine the amount each person has to pay.

**Skills and Concepts Learned**

This project allowed me to practice several essential Python programming concepts, including:

		**Primitive data types**, **Type checking and Conversion**, **Mathematical operations and Number manipulation**, **Fstrings**.

**Future Improvements**

While this program is functional, there is always room for improvement.

Thank you for checking out my Tip Calculator project, and I hope you find it as fun and entertaining as I did while creating it!
