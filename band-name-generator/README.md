#Band Name Generator
Welcome to the Band Name Generator, a Python program that generates unique and creative names for your band based on the input provided by the user. This project is part of my Python course, and it is designed to showcase my skills and knowledge of Python programming.
This directory contains the main.py file where the code is writing, a venv directory that contains the environment setting and this readme fle.

#How to use the Band Name Generator
To use the Band Name Generator, simply download the source code and run the main.py file in the band-name-generator folder in your Python environment.
Or use this link and click the play button: https://replit.com/@Emmanuel1707/Band-name-generator?v=1

The program will prompt the user to provide two inputs:
	-A city or town that the user grew up in
	-A pet's name
	Based on these inputs, the program will generate a unique band name that combines the city/town and pet's name in a creative and fun way.

#Skills and Concepts Learned
This project allowed me to practice several essential Python programming concepts, including:

#User input and output functions
String manipulation and concatenation
Additionally, I learned how to structure a Python program by defining functions.

#Future Improvements
While this program is functional and generates unique band names, there is always room for improvement.

Thank you for checking out my Band Name Generator project, and I hope you find it as fun and entertaining as I did while creating it!
