**Blind Auction**

Are you ready for the ultimate adrenaline rush? Welcome to the Blind Auction program! With this program, you can participate in an auction like never before. The catch? You won't know who your opponents are or how much they're bidding. It's a high-stakes game of wits and nerve, and you'll need to stake as high as you can to come out on top.

But be warned: in the Blind Auction, every bid counts. Miss out on one crucial move, and you could lose your chance at the prize. It's a heart-pounding experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

This project is part of my Python course, and it is designed to showcase my skills and knowledge of Python programming.
This directory contains the main.py file where the code is writing, a art.py file to store the program logo, a venv directory that contains the environment setting and this readme fle.

**Future Improvements**

While this program is functional, there is always room for improvement.
