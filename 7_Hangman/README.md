**Hangman**

Get ready for an exciting journey into the world of words with the Hangman game! If you're a word lover, then this game is just for you. With the Hangman game, you'll put your vocabulary and deduction skills to the test, as you try to guess each letter in a hidden word before time runs out.

But be warned, every wrong guess will cost you a precious life! With each incorrect guess, the hangman's noose will tighten, bringing you one step closer to defeat. Can you beat the odds and guess the word before it's too late?

This project is part of my Python course, and it is designed to showcase my skills and knowledge of Python programming.
This directory contains the main.py file where the code is written, a art and word list file, a venv directory that contains the environment setting and this readme fle.
